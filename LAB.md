#### Test
* Test your app using Cypress.io. Your test runner should go through the following scenario:
  * The user arrives at the homepage located at `/`
  * The user clicks on the `Dasboard` link in the navbar and should see the `Dashboard` component form to enter a note. In addition, the URL pathname should now be `/dashboard`.
  * The user enters a title and content into the input fields and submits the form to create a new note.
  * A new note should be displayed on the page in an unordered list.
 * Write any combination of explicit/implicit assertion statements in order to test your app. You will get full credit for testing if a TA can run your tests in Cypress and see the required scenario take place.
